# Terrace Gardening by Bharti - SwiftUI App

Welcome to the **Terrace Gardening by Bharti** app! This app is a simple and dynamic mobile application built using **SwiftUI** to showcase various terrace gardening tips and tutorials. The app allows users to view a list of videos related to gardening, each with an image, title, upload date, and direct links to YouTube.

## Features
- **Dynamic Video List**: A scrollable list of gardening videos with thumbnails and titles.
- **Interactive Links**: Clickable video titles that take the user to YouTube for detailed tutorials.
- **Programmatic UI**: The app is built entirely using SwiftUI without storyboards, focusing on programmatic UI development.
- **Data Management**: Videos are fetched and displayed programmatically using `@State`, `@Binding`, and `ForEach`.

## Tools & Technologies
